      <h2>History and Description</h2>
      <p>
        The origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that
        was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in the 14th century, spanning
        parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was
        grown. The dish has its roots in a traditional dish called
        thieboudienne, containing rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables.[3] Food
        and agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible
        given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger valley, but considers it
        unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current
        range since such a diffusion is not seen in "linguistic, historical or
        political patterns". Instead he proposes that the dish spread with the
        Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to
        the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic
        arts of "blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy" as
        well as the religion of Islam.[2] Marc Dufumier, an emeritus professor
        of agronomy, proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only
        have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive
        peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and
        where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet
        and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice
        from Southeast Asia.[4] It may then have spread throughout the region
        through the historical commercial, cultural and religious channels
        linking Senegal with Ghana, Nigeria and beyond, many of which continue
        to thrive today, such as the Tijāniyyah Sufi brotherhood bringing
        thousands of West African pilgrims to Senegal annually.

        Although considerable variation exists, the basic profile for Nigerian
        jollof rice includes long-grain parboiled rice, tomatoes and tomato
        paste, pepper, vegetable oil, onions, and stock cubes. Most of the
        ingredients are cooked in one pot, of which a rich meat stock and a
        fried tomato and pepper puree characteristically forms the base. Rice is
        then added and left to cook in the liquid. The dish is then served with
        the protein of choice and very often with fried plantains, moi moi,
        steamed vegetables, coleslaw, salad, etc.[16] In the riverine areas of
        Nigeria where seafood is the main source of protein, seafood often takes
        the place of chicken or meat as the protein of choice.

              Jollof rice traditionally consists of rice, cooking oil,
              vegetables such as tomato, onion, red pepper, garlic, ginger and
              Scotch bonnet chilli peppers. To enhance the colour of the dish,
              tomato paste (purée) is added.
              <br />
              As seasoning, spices, salt, stock cubes (a blend of flavour
              enhancers, salt, nutmeg and herbs), curry powder and dried thyme
              are used. To complement the dish, chicken, turkey, beef or fish
              are often served with the dish.

          peppers
        </li>
        <li>
          habanero peppers as they are sometimes called) 1/4 cup of groundnut
          oil
        </li>
        <li>
          3 tbsp tomato paste 2 cups of parboiled rice 2 1/2 cups of chicken
          stock
        </li>
        <li>
          1 tsp salt to taste 1/2 tsp curry powder 1/2 tsp thyme 1 tsp All
          purpose
        </li>
        <li>seasoning 1 Knorr stock cube 3 bay leaves Water, as needed</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food
          processor or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure that everything
          is blended well.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil
          is heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn
          golden brown. Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the
          tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato
          mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside) and fry the mixture with
          the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes. Make sure you stir
          consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken
          stock. Mix and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all
          purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for 10
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato
          stew. At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is level
          with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. Add the bay
          leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew,
          cover, and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid
          has completely dried up. Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your
          Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!
